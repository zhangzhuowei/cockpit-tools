# CLIProxyAPI upstream sync

The bundled source under `third_party/CLIProxyAPI` is synchronized to the
`CLIProxyAPI` `v7.2.155` source tree with Cockpit compatibility shims. The outer
sidecar module declares the same upstream version and continues to use the local
`replace` target.

## Codex sync scope

- Upstream repository: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI`
- Synchronized module baseline: `v7.2.155` (`7fac6b15`)
- Codex Live baseline: the upstream Live implementation plus later capability,
  client-secret, WebSocket, media-relay, and TCP-proxy commits
- Cockpit integration routes: `POST /v1/live`, `GET /v1/live/:call_id`,
  `POST /v1/realtime/calls`, and `GET /v1/realtime/calls/:call_id`

Cockpit uses the upstream Codex executor, Responses WebSocket, model catalog,
auth scheduler, Live request/sideband/realtime implementation, and supporting
config/proxy utilities. The outer relay keeps API-key account scoping and rejects
provider-gateway profiles because Codex Live requires a ChatGPT OAuth credential.

## Codex/API policy convergence

The local `CLIProxyAPI` v7.2.157 tree (`09a29bd3`) is the reference for Codex and
Responses API behavior. This is a targeted policy alignment, not a full upgrade
of the bundled v7.2.155 dependency tree.

- Removed the local device/session/full fingerprint rewrite and automatic host
  projection; old account fields are retained only for import/export compatibility.
- Removed the local official-client restriction and third-party-client exceptions,
  including global/per-account controls and runtime metadata projection. Clients
  still require the normal API key and remain subject to account-scoping rules.
- Removed the API-Service-only capacity wrapper, error-code rewriting and
  transient-request cooldown bypass. The v7.2.157 bootstrap capacity detection,
  `model_not_found` account rotation, optional model-level cooling, and permanent
  OAuth failure handling are used instead.
- Removed extra host/WebSocket input namespace deletion and the retired Rust
  gateway dispatch/rejected-field retry path. Removed the uncalled handler-level
  encrypted-content retry helper; request history is not stripped and replayed.
  Protocol translators,
  signature validation, token accounting and upstream session safety remain intact.
- Retained Cockpit token authority, scoped keys, instance-specific gateways,
  Responses Lite integration, and Agent Identity as local extensions.
  Agent Identity has no equivalent in the reference tree and is not removed
  without an explicit decision about existing accounts.
- Synchronized the v7.2.157 Responses transport fixes: official nested SSE error
  payloads with preserved sequence numbers, split-CRLF framing, WebSocket prewarm
  follow-up merging, and named `function_call_output` passthrough.
- Synchronized Codex schema/header compatibility and model additions: unsupported
  Unicode property regexes are removed from tool schemas, `$CPA-SESSION-ID`
  custom headers resolve from the canonical request session, and the
  `gpt-image-2.5-flare` / `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst` image variants are accepted.
  Cockpit keeps `gpt-5.5` and `gpt-image-2.5` as its local image defaults.

## Update procedure

1. Compare the next upstream tag against the targeted `v7.2.157` policy baseline,
   while separately assessing a full dependency-tree upgrade from `v7.2.155`.
   Begin with
   `internal/runtime/executor/codex*`, `internal/client/codex`, `sdk/cliproxy/auth`,
   `sdk/api/handlers`, `internal/config`, `internal/registry`, and `sdk/proxyutil`.
2. Port the complete dependency closure instead of copying a single changed file.
3. Preserve Cockpit-specific executor identity, token ownership, account routing,
   quota, and request-policy compatibility shims.
4. Run the focused Codex executor/Live tests, sidecar tests, and a sidecar build.
